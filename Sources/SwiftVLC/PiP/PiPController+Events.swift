  ///
  /// Each access returns an independent, unbounded stream — lifecycle
  /// events are one-shot and low-rate, so no event is ever dropped for
  /// a live subscriber. Streams finish when the controller deinits.
  ///
  /// ## Backend fidelity
  ///
  /// On the **sample-buffer path** (a directly constructed
  /// `PiPController`), SwiftVLC owns the `AVPictureInPictureController`
  /// delegate and every case is delivered, including
  /// ``PiPEvent/willStart``, ``PiPEvent/willStop(reason:)`` and
  /// ``PiPEvent/failedToStart(_:)`` with the underlying AVKit error.
  ///
  /// On the **native drawable path** (``PiPVideoView``), libVLC owns
  /// the AVKit controller and its delegate; the only signal SwiftVLC
  /// observes is the active flag flipping. There the stream degrades
  /// to synthesized ``PiPEvent/didStart`` / ``PiPEvent/didStop(reason:)``
  /// events whose reason is always ``PiPStopReason/unknown``;
  /// will/failed events are unavailable. A native-handle replacement
  /// while PiP is active (player swap, renderer recast) tears PiP down
  /// the same way and is likewise reported as `didStop(reason: .unknown)`.
  ///
  /// ## Stop-reason resolution
  ///
  /// The reason attached to ``PiPEvent/didStop(reason:)`` is resolved
  /// in this order:
  ///
  /// 1. The **first discriminating signal** observed for the in-flight
  ///    stop wins and is never overwritten: the restore callback
  ///    records ``PiPStopReason/restoreRequested``, a start failure
  ///    records ``PiPStopReason/failure``, and a programmatic
  ///    ``stop()`` records ``PiPStopReason/unknown``. In practice these
  ///    signals are mutually exclusive, which yields the effective
  ///    precedence `restoreRequested` > `failure` over the fallbacks
  ///    below.
  /// 2. Otherwise, if the player reported a natural end of media
  ///    (``Player/didReachEnd``), the stop is ``PiPStopReason/mediaEnded``.
  /// 3. Otherwise ``PiPStopReason/userClosed`` — on the sample-buffer
  ///    path the close (X) button is the only remaining cause.
  ///
  /// ``PiPEvent/willStop(reason:)`` carries the best-known reason at
  /// emission time. AVKit guarantees the restore callback completes
  /// before the stop finishes (so `didStop` always sees it) but does
  /// not document its order relative to `willStop`; treat `didStop`'s
  /// reason as authoritative.
  public var pipEvents: AsyncStream<PiPEvent> {
    pipEventBroadcaster.subscribe(policy: .unbounded)
