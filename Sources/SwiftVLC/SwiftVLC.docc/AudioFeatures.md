# Audio features

Tune volume, output routing, channel mixing, and equalization.

## Volume, mute, delay

```swift
try player.setAudioVolume(0.8)             // 0.0 silent, 1.0 is 100%, up to 2.0
player.isMuted = false
try player.setAudioDelay(.milliseconds(30)) // positive = audio plays later
```

Volume is normalized, so `0.0 ... 1.0` covers the useful range; values
above `1.0` software-amplify beyond normal (capped at 2.0 / 200%) and
can distort on quietly-mastered content.

## Output modules and devices

List available output modules (CoreAudio, auhal, etc.) for the running
instance:

```swift
for module in VLCInstance.shared.audioOutputs() {
    print(module.name, module.outputDescription)
}
try player.setAudioOutput("auhal")   // macOS example
```

Then pick a device within that module:

```swift
for device in player.audioDevices() {
    print(device.deviceId, device.deviceDescription)
}
try player.setAudioDevice("external-speakers-uid")
```

Observe ``PlayerEvent/audioDeviceChanged(_:)`` if you need to react to
system-initiated device changes (e.g. headphones connecting).

## Equalizer

``Equalizer`` is a 10-band graphic EQ with preamp and preset support.
Build one, tune it, and attach it to a player:

```swift
let eq = Equalizer()
eq.preampGain = 4.0                          // dB; clamped to -20...+20
try eq.setAmplification(5.0, forBand: 0)     // bass lift
player.equalizer = eq
```

Typed gain accessors wrap raw `Float` values in ``EqualizerGain``.
Each value is clamped to libVLC's `-20.0 ... +20.0` dB range:

```swift
eq.preampGain = .flat
try eq.setBandGains([+3.0, +2.0, .flat, -1.0, -2.0, -2.0, -1.0, .flat, +1.0, +2.0])
try eq.setGain(+6.0, forBand: 3)
```

Use a built-in preset by index:

```swift
if let rock = Equalizer(preset: Equalizer.presetNames.firstIndex(of: "Rock") ?? 0) {
    player.equalizer = rock
}
```

Pass `nil` to disable: `player.equalizer = nil`.

## Channel layout

Two independent properties shape the output signal:

- ``Player/stereoMode`` picks a stereo transformation (standard,
  reversed, mono, or Dolby Surround).
- ``Player/mixMode`` selects the channel count of the final mix,
  including stereo, 4.0, 5.1, 7.1, and binaural rendering for
  headphones.

```swift
player.stereoMode = .mono        // collapse to mono
player.mixMode = .binaural       // spatialize for headphones
```

## Role hints

Pass libVLC an audio-role hint. The effect depends on the platform and
active output module:

```swift
player.role = .music         // long-form listening
player.role = .communication // voice/video calls
```

See ``PlayerRole`` for the full set.
