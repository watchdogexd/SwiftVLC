/// regressions in the async-deinit plumbing: use-after-free on the
/// retained callback box, double-release, leaked `VLCInstance`
/// references, or a deadlock if cleanup ordering drifts.
///
/// Serial (`--no-parallel` in CI). Each test asserts *on its own
/// thread* that construction and destruction complete without
/// crashing — the offloaded cleanup runs on the utility queue
/// independently, so the test body deliberately doesn't wait for it.
/// If the offload ever had a bug that the current thread could observe
/// (e.g. use-after-free via a retained pointer), the loop body — not a
/// post-loop sleep — is where it would surface.
