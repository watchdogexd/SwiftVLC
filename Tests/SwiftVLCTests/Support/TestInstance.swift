/// VLC instances tuned for deterministic integration tests.
///
/// Two problems rule out using `VLCInstance.shared` directly from tests:
///
/// 1. **No `NSApplication` / window server / audio device in
///    `swift test`.** libVLC's real vout and aout modules fail to
///    initialize and the decoder stalls before reaching `.playing`.
///    The `dummy` output modules (wired via ``makePlayback()`` and
///    ``shared``) provide no-op sinks so the decoder can progress.
/// 2. **Cross-test libVLC state.** The debug libVLC carries per-instance
///    decoder / aout state that occasionally survives a `Player`
///    teardown and trips `assert(stream->timing.pause_date ==
///    VLC_TICK_INVALID)` when the next test rapidly creates another
///    player on the same instance. Giving each playback-driving test
///    its own instance isolates that state.
///
/// The cost of a fresh instance (~50 ms) is negligible. Tests that only
/// create and destroy objects without reaching `.playing` can use
/// ``lifecycleShared`` (no outputs, skips the stream-play path);
/// playback-driving tests that don't need per-test isolation can use
/// ``shared`` (dummy outputs).

  /// pause/resume on the debug libvlc, trips
